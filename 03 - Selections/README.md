#### 0301 (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) 
ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays
the result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two
roots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display 'The equation
has no real roots.'

#### 0303 (Algebra: solve linear equations) 
You can use Cramer’s rule to solve the following system of linear equation:
ax + by = e    
cx + dy = f  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and display the
result. If ad – bc is 0, report that The equation has no solution.
#### 0312 (Check a number)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and checks whether the number is divisible by both 5 and 6, divisible by 5 or 6, or just
one of them (but not both).
#### 0322 (Geometry: point in a circle)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the circle centered at (0, 0) with
radius 10.
