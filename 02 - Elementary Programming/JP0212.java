/*
2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula: length = v^2 / (2a)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
length. Here is a sample run:
Enter speed 60
Enter acceleration: 3.5
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.2857
